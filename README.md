# Phillips-Curve-with-Labor-Market-Power-The-Case-of-the-Colombian-Labor-Market
### Abstract

This ongoing research examines the influence of labor market power (monopsony) on workers' wages, analyzed through a Phillips curve framework in the Colombian labor market from 2008 to 2020. By exploring the dynamics between employer concentration and wage-setting mechanisms, this study aims to provide insights into the extent to which monopsonistic practices affect wage levels and employment conditions. The findings are expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of labor market inefficiencies and inform policy recommendations to enhance labor market outcomes in Colombia.
